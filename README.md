üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Fake Profile Detector is a machine learning project designed to identify fake user profiles on social media and online platforms. In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of fake profiles poses significant challenges, including misinformation, scams, and cybersecurity threats. This project aims to combat these issues by developing a robust and accurate fake profile detection system.



### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for model training.

- **Feature Engineering**: We employ feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from user profiles, enhancing the model's ability to identify fake profiles.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, are explored and compared to determine the best-performing model.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: The project uses accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to evaluate the model's performance.
